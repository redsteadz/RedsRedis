# RedsRedis

## Overview
RedsRedis is a high-performance, multi-threaded Redis-like database implemented in C++. It supports a variety of data structures and features, including offset-based retrieval and an efficient packet system for data communication.

## Features
- **Multi-threading**: Optimized concurrency for handling multiple client requests.
- **Data Structures**:
  - **Hash Tables** for key-value storage.
  - **ZSets (Sorted Sets)** for ordered data.
  - **AVL Trees** for balanced search operations.
  - **Heaps** for priority-based retrieval.
- **Offset-Based Retrieval**: Efficient querying using data offsets for high-speed lookups.
- **Packet System**: A structured packet system for handling multiple data types and requests seamlessly.
- **Optimized Performance**: Leveraging advanced data structures and threading for scalability and speed.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **CMake** (for project configuration)
- **GCC/Clang** (for compiling C++ code)
- **Make** (or an equivalent build tool)

### Build Instructions
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RedsRedis.git
cd RedsRedis

# Create a build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Run CMake
cmake ..

# Compile the project
make
```

## Usage
Run the server:
```sh
./Server
```

### Example Commands
- **Set a key-value pair:**
  ```sh
  set key value
  ```
- **Retrieve a value:**
  ```sh
  get key
  ```
- **Insert into a sorted set:**
  ```sh
  zadd myset 10 value1
  ```
- **Retrieve from an offset:**
  ```sh
  zquery myset 5 value1 r1 r2
  ```

## Performance Optimizations
- **Lock-free structures** where possible to minimize contention.
- **Efficient memory management** using pools and custom allocators.
- **Batch processing support** for handling multiple requests efficiently.

## Roadmap
- Implement replication support.
- Add persistence for durable storage.
- Improve clustering capabilities.
